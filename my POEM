On a dull grey day. With littele exitement
The Skies parted and the was a blue blob falling.
This is the way
i went about 
got there and 
fished around.
I could fly.
I fell and slid.
Ah, ma glob.
Do you remember how they looked,
They were running up the slope.
The Green frogs with their beady eyes.
Laughing and dancing. climbing the hill.
They saw me and lent a hand?
I don't quite remember.
"What's happeneng? Where am I?", I groaned.
My head punding. With blured eyes and a sharp ringing in my left ear.

A wrinkeled frog popped out its head and said.
"Ypu sure bumped your nogen"
