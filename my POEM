On a dull grey day. With little excitement
The Skies parted and there was a blue blob falling.
This is the way
i went about 
got there and 
fished around.
I could fly.
I fell and slid.
Ah, ma glob.
Do you remember how they looked,
They were running up the slope.
The Green frogs with their beady eyes.
Laughing and dancing. climbing the hill.


They saw me and lent a hand?
I don't quite remember.
"What's happening? Where am I?", I groaned.
My head pounding. With blurred eyes and my bones nearly all pointing in the wrong directions.

A wrinkled frog popped out its head and said.
"You sure bumped your noggin"

I jumped up, fell on my butt and scurried backwards till I hit a the  wall. 
"*****, what the?"

Old man chuckles, and tosses over a bag of 'cold things'.
"Take this , soften the bump".

"So what brings you here to molgoPlex? We don't get many new people."
