On a dull grey day. With littele exitement
The Skies parted and the was a blue blob falling.
This is the way
i went about 
got there and 
fished around.
I could fly.
I fell and slid.
Ah, ma glob.
Do you remember how they looked,
They were running up the slope.
The Green frogs with their beady eyes.
Laughing and dancing. climbing the hill.
